📦 Delivery Delay Analysis
📖 Project Overview

This project, titled Delivery Delay Analysis, focuses on analyzing e-commerce delivery performance using a real-world dataset. The primary objective is to identify patterns in order volumes, delivery times, delays, and refunds, thereby uncovering insights into operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue trends.

The analysis was carried out by cleaning raw data, preprocessing it for accuracy, and then creating an interactive Power BI dashboard that visually presents key findings.

🗂 Dataset Details

The dataset was sourced from an e-commerce platform and initially contained several inconsistencies, such as missing values, outliers, and unstructured fields.

Key Preprocessing Steps

✅ Removed missing values, outliers, and duplicates

✅ Dropped irrelevant or non-required columns

✅ Created a new column for structured analysis

✅ Split unstructured “Order Date & Time” into separate Date and Time fields

✅ Ensured consistent formatting for smooth visualization

📊 Key Visualizations & Insights

The Power BI dashboard includes the following visuals:

KPI Cards:

Count of Orders (business volume)

Average Delivery Time (operational efficiency)

Delayed Orders % (service reliability)

Refund Rate % (customer satisfaction issues)

Total Order Value in Millions (revenue performance)

Bar Chart: Comparing on-time vs delayed deliveries across platforms (Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, JioMart).

Line Chart: Tracking delivery delays over time (Jan 2015 – Feb 2016) to identify seasonal patterns and performance shifts.

Trend & Category Analysis: Highlighting which categories/platforms face higher delays and their impact on revenue.
